# Material for Schools and Workshops on Univalent Mathematics

## Installation
1. Follow instructions [Preparing your computer](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md#preparing-your-computer) of the [UniMath installation guide](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
2. Follow instructions [Installation of ProofGeneral](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md#installation-of-proofgeneral-all-operating-systems) of the [UniMath installation guide](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
3. Type the following into a terminal:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/UniMath/Schools
   $ cd Schools
   $ make
   ```
   This last step will take a long time: as part of that step, UniMath and Coq are downloaded and compiled.
4. See the [usage instructions](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/USAGE.md) for information on how to step through the exercise files located in the subdirectories [`2017-12-Birmingham`](https://github.com/UniMath/Schools/tree/master/2017-12-Birmingham) and [`2019-04-Birmingham`](https://github.com/UniMath/Schools/tree/master/2019-04-Birmingham). Note that the automatic setup of the work environment mentioned in the usage instructions has been extended for this repository to encompass these subdirectories.
